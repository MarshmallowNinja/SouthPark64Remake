			STARTING INFORMATION

The Marshmallow Studios (MMS) Fan-works License is a free license that
was created for Interactive Software such as video games and computer software.
This license grants no warranty for the end user and no liability to the
creators of this license (MMS).
This license works to inspire creativity and innovation while still
respecting copyright laws and the wishes of copyright holders and creators.

				PREAMBLE

Creating and developing products with copyright, trademarks, licenses, or
patents may necessitate permissions or licenses from the relevant rights
holders, which the mentioned creators and developers are unlikely to have
because the process is costly and could involve complex legal procedures.

The licensed work has such an emotional impact on the creators that they either
want to see it in fresh ways, like in a different medium, or create new
experiences using the locations and characters from it, or they choose to
remake an earlier work.

The creator(s) using this license understand that monetizing,
commercializing, or earning any form of financial income from this product
is unlawful. Furthermore, it is recognized that owners of copyrights and
trademarks have the legal right to assert their rights and take action
against the authors if they believe their intellectual property is being
infringed upon, as it is in their legal right to do so.

To keep fan works free for all, this license also requires creators to
keep the software open-source, which means that the code used to create
the product must be accessible and available for anyone to view, modify, and
even distribute as long as they also have this same license in their code
if they use copyrighted content in their project.

This license strives for free, non-commercial use of copyrighted content and
even encourages copyright holders to license creators who use their protected
content in a respectful, ethical, and innovative way. Not only for video games
and software, but also for writing, cinema, animation, music, and any other
type of entertainment, as spreading culture and information can enrich the
world with new forms of expression and media discussion.
