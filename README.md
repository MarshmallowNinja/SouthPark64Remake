# South Park 64 Remake
 Complete remake of the 1998 game, South Park. Also known as South Park: Deeply Impacted. Also known as *south park snowball game for the 64*.
 This is the main, stable fork of the game that holds major versions.
 For a near-constantly updated, unstable fork of this game. Here is the unstable fork: https://github.com/MarshmallowNinja/SouthPark64Remake/tree/unstable

 This remake is being made completely from the ground up, with no sort of monetization at all for the end user.
